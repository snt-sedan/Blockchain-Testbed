The steps to build a private blockchain
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install the ethereum in each node
2. All node must have identifical Genesis file (e.g.CommonGenesis.json)
3. The static node id should be given to each node to build the network.
4. Create account on each node.
5. Each node should run for mining for a while.
6. Each node should see the root static node. 
7. We need to run some node in mining mode to serve the blockchain
